# Image Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Add Your Images

Place your images in this folder (`src/assets/images/`) with these names:

### For Hero Section (White Tiger):
- `white-tiger-hero.jpg` (or `.png`) - The white tiger with blue energy ring

### For Services Section (Cafe Interior):
- `cafe-interior-1.jpg` (or `.png`) - Gaming cafe interior image
- `cafe-interior-2.jpg` (or `.png`) - Alternative cafe interior image

## Step 2: Supported Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp` (recommended for better performance)

## Step 3: Image Optimization Tips
- Hero image: Recommended size ~1920x1080px
- Background images: Recommended size ~1920x1080px or larger
- Use image compression tools to reduce file size while maintaining quality

## Current Setup
The code is already configured to use these images. Once you add them to this folder, they will automatically appear in:
- Hero section: White tiger background
- Services section: Cafe interior background (optional)
