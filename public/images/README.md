# Image Setup Instructions

## 📸 How to Add Your Images

### Step 1: Add Your Images Here
Place your images directly in this folder (`public/images/`) with these exact names:

### Required Images:

1. **Hero Section Background:**
   - File name: `white-tiger-hero.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)
   - Description: White tiger with blue energy ring
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger
   - This will appear as the background of the main hero section

2. **Services Section Background:**
   - File name: `cafe-interior-1.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)
   - Description: Gaming cafe interior with RGB lighting
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger
   - This will appear as the background of the services section

### Step 2: Supported Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` (most common)
- `.png` (for images with transparency)
- `.webp` (best performance, smaller file size)

### Step 3: Image Optimization Tips
- **Compress images** before adding them (use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh)
- **Recommended file sizes:**
  - Hero image: Under 500KB
  - Services image: Under 500KB
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 works best for backgrounds

### Step 4: After Adding Images
1. Save your images in this folder with the correct names
2. Refresh your browser (or restart `npm run dev` if needed)
3. The images should automatically appear!

## Current Image Usage

- **Hero Section:** Uses `white-tiger-hero.jpg`
- **Services Section:** Uses `cafe-interior-1.jpg`

## Troubleshooting

If images don't appear:
1. Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure images are in `public/images/` folder (not `src/assets/images/`)
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for any errors
